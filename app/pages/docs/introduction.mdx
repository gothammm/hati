# Introduction

Hati is an open source UI Component Library for SolidJS built with [Ark](https://ark-ui.com "title") and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/ "title"), it provides a
set of ready to use components to super charge your SolidJS apps.


<Alert variant="error" classList={{"mt-8": true }}>
  <AlertCircle class="h-4 w-4" />
  <AlertTitle>This is a work in progress and the version available in `npm` is not up to date.</AlertTitle>
</Alert>

## Why Hati?

- Hati is an opinionated component library, and does not have any out of the box themed customizations.
- It is essentially meant to be a plug and play library, and lets you focus on building your applications, rather than customizations.
- Why no customizations? simple, we want to keep it as simple as possible, ofcourse styles can be easily overwritten via the `class` props.
